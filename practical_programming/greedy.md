## Greedy Algorithm

> "A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum." - [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)

This approach, usually a step further from brute force, keeps the best answer 'so far' in memory.
